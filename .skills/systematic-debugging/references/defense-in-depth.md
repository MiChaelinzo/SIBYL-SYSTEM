Defense in Depth
Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause.

Principle
Single point of validation fails. Add checks at multiple layers.

Layers
Input boundary - First entry point
Processing - Transform/shape data
Output - Before returning
Storage - Before saving
Display - UI rendering
When to Use
After finding root cause, add validation at:

The source (fix root cause)
Additional layers (guard against future changes)
Example
Root cause: API returns null for missing user

Defense in depth:
1. API layer - Handle null, return empty object
2. Service layer - Validate before processing  
3. Component - Show fallback if no user
4. Type system - Make user optional in types
Key Point
Fix root cause, then add guards at other layers.
